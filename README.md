ABIS
====
This project is an interpreter for a programing language i created myself.
This interpreter is supposed to be used in projects were you would like to give to the user some extra functinality by allowing them to run ABIS scripts in your aplication.

This is still in a very early development stage and a lot of things can change.

This is the c# version of it. I intend to develop a rust version to.

This project was inspired by the programing language [Porth] by the streamer [Tsoding](twitch.tv/tsoding)
