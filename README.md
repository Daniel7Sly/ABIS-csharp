ABIS
====
This project is an interpreter for a programming language i created myself.
This interpreter is supposed to be used in projects where you would like to give the user some extra functinality by allowing them to run ABIS scripts in your aplication.

This is still in a very early development stage and a lot of things can change.

This is the c# version of it. I intend to develop a rust version too.

This project was inspired by the programing language [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth) by the streamer [Tsoding](twitch.tv/tsoding). (the languages have nothing in common btw)
